## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
    - Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I encountered dozens of problems, as result, I learned dozens of lessons. The main realization I got was how customizable tailwind actually is. I used to hate it as it cluttered my HTML. I didn't know you could extract complex styling into its own class with @apply. 

**Before**:
```html
<section id="state_rating" class="flex bg-gray-800 rounded-3xl flex-col gap-8 px-6 py-10">
```

**After**
```html
<section id="state_rating" class="flex card">
```
```css
@layer components {
    .card {
        @apply bg-gray-800 rounded-3xl flex-col gap-8 px-6 py-10;
    }
}
```
